Passionate for their culture, passionate for their views, passionate for the shows they watch, for the food they eat, for the places they visit, for the festivals they celebrate, for politics, for songs, for Bollywood etc. but these passionate people become extra passionate in a field which separates the love and passion than the rest of the things, It is Cricket.

            Cricket may be a pastime leisure sport in some of the countries, An activity to earn their living in some of the countries but when it comes to India there are only two words which can describe cricket on India Firstly love and secondly madness.
            
            People love this sport so much in India that their entire lives revolve around cricket, From making friends on the cricket field to spending time with friends talking about cricket, the moods of the people are determined by The performance of their national team in cricket. From Kapil dev to Virat Kohli India has produced one of the best cricketing talents in the world, the talent kept going higher by the years So did the love and passion for the fans towards the game.
            India has won two world cup One in 1983 and one in 2011 both holding a significant place in Indian history. The first cup ensured that Cricket will not be like another sport in the country instead will be loved by all And the second one ensured that the love this sport is getting in the country will break all the records and will be the most loved and followed thing in India Overcoming Politics and Bollywood combined.
            
            During the years the fan base of cricket grew and even the cricket base currently is now divided into two major believers.
            
            The first one is the true cricket fans who watch even the test cricket they love test cricket considering it as the purest form of the game.
            They watch every match irrespective of the opponents or the time.
            The second’s ones which are majorly the new generation which just watches the t20 cricket and watch cricket for fun and never watch the test cricket.
            
            They decide to watch matches seeing the opponents.
            Sadly the second ones are the majority in number which has been a major reason for the downfall of test cricket and the highly increasing popularity of the biggest t20 cricket league in India The Indian Premier League.
            
            After India won the t20 world cup in 2007 the craze for t20 grew in India.
            
            Then came the IPL which was a revolutionary step in Indian cricket and world cricket too. IPL now is one of the most-watched cricket tournaments all over the world.
